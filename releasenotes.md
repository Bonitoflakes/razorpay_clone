### Navbar height - For any element whose height is not finite, height property should not be set. In this case, you can make the nav items arranged using padding.

- Finite height replaced for navbar

### Padding to fold class - currently the elements were arranged at middle using padding instead we can use width and max width to center them.In my screen, since padding is set as a finite value, image and content is vertically aligned by breaking to next line

- This was happening since I used flex-wrap ??
- Ik it's a bad idea, but that paddding had little to no layout modifiers there, should have used a container class throughout the site, didn't think through at tht time, was doing the site in small chunks didn't go for modularity.

### Border missing to Accept payments with Razorpay...

- misssed it when modifying the class for another section: Explore RazorpayX powered Business Banking

TODO:

- Business Banking is causing overflow issues.
- Z-index for the arrow design is not working as expected.
